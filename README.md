# Corona-Data-Visualization-with-Matplotlib
In this project, Corona data from Kaggle is imported, summarized and Visualizations created using Matplotlib. We are able to visualize the Corona Deaths per Continent, Corona Recoveries Per Continent and Number of Tests Per Continent. Finally, we investigate whether there is a correlation between Population,TotalCases,TotalDeaths and TotalTests.
